Started as a study by:
Rémi Denis-Courmont <deniscr6 (at) cti (dot) ecp.fr>,
engineering student at Ecole Centrale Paris, March-April 2004.

Maintained by Rémi Denis-Courmont <rdenis (at) simphalempin (dot) com>

Some parts that might fall under the Ecole Centrale Paris's large
innovation protection rules for students were carefully stripped from the
package, pending an agreement with the school's executives.


The school namely preempts copyrights on works done either:

1/ as part af the scholarship, _with_ the intervention of someone working for
   the university:
     That is the case for some additionnal (french) documentation written
     about the study, which was supervised by François Xavier Potel, which I
     thank a lot for his help along the initial project.

     That is fortunately not really the case for the program's source code,
     which I wrote entirely myself, without external help.

2/ with knowledge, techniques and/or data specific to the school:
     That is obviously not the case for any part of the program.

3/ with means from the school:
     To some extent, that might be true for testing material, as the school's
     Internet connectivity was used for testing purpose. That includes most of
     the packet captures (though not all of them) that I did.
