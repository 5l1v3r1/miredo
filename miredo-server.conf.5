.SH NAME
miredo-server.conf \- configuration for miredo-server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B miredo-server.conf

.SH DESCRIPTON
.I miredo-server.conf
.RB " is the configuration file for " "miredo-server" "."
Each configuration directive consists of one directive name, possibly
followed by one or several spaces and a value for the directive.
White spaces, empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.

Directives are case-insensitive. A comprehensive list of the supported
directives follows:

.SH SERVER OPTION

.TP
.BI "Prefix " "teredo_prefix"
.RB "This directive specifies the " "Teredo prefix" " which the Teredo"
relay and/or server will advertise.
.IR "teredo_prefix" " must be a valid IPv6 prefix."

.RB "Currently, the default value is " "3ffe:831f:: but it is subject"
to change.

.TP
.BI "ServerBindAddress " "server_ip"
Specifies the primary IPv4 address of the Teredo server.
miredo-server will bind to UDP/IPv4 port 3544 on this address and waits
for packets from Teredo clients. It will advertise the Teredo prefix
.RB "which is defined with the " "Prefix" " directive."

A Teredo server needs two subsequent IPv4 addresses. It will wait for
UDP IPv4 packets on port 3544 on both addresses.
.IR "server_ip" " specifies the lowest of both IPv4 addresses, which is"
known as the primary IPv4 server address. The secondary IPv4 address
.RB "should be " "server_ip + 1" " and must also be assigned to the "
server.

.TP
.BI "SyslogFacility " "facility"
Specify which syslog's facility is to be used by miredo-server for
logging.
.RB "Possible values are: " "daemon" " (the default), " "local0" ","
.RB "... " "local7" ", " "kern" " and " "user" " (see syslog(2))."
