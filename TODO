(?) not sure if it should/could be done

----------------------------
(*) do something in case of DoS against the peers list
( ) fixed TODOs and FIXMEs in source code
(*) local Teredo discovery
(*) interval determination procedure
(!) document libteredo-mire (manpage? --help, --version)

Not so important features:
---------------------------

    can be done with the OS firewall
(*) some statistics
(H) other localizations
( ) support for UPnP IGD to open an UDP port on supporting NATs

Conformance:
-------------
(*) limit sending of bubbles (not completed yet)
(*) send unreachable in response when dropping previously queued packets

Security:
----------

( ) automatic/dynamic relay access control list
    (stateful firewall-like)

Performance/scalability:
-------------------------
( ) check if libtun6 could use kernel checksumming
    or if it should disable it
( ) check if libteredo-server could use kernel for checksumming

Extension:
-----------
( ) support symmetric to non-symmetric NAT traversal
(?) support symmetric NAT traversal

Portability:
-------------
(H) big-endianess compatibility tests
(H) byte alignement tests on problematic platforms (not i386)
(H) Solaris: libtun6 support
(H) Solaris: tests & fixes
(H) Darwin: tests & fixes
(H) DragonFlyBSD: tests & fixes

Documentation & support:
-------------------------
( ) custom INSTALL file
( ) RPM packaging
