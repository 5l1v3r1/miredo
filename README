  Welcome to Miredo's introduction manual!

Where to go?
-------------
  If you've used olders versions of this program, you should read NEWS
for a summary of the most recent updates and changes.

  For detailled usage instructions, you should refer to the Unix manual
page miredo(8) which should be provided with your copy of the program.
In fact, it was not written yet, so you're out of luck.

  See INSTALL for instructions on how to build the package and install
the program from sources.

  This package is distributed under the terms of the General Public
License (GPL) version 2 written by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.
for full licensing details, please read COPYING.

  This software is at a very early development stage. Do NOT use it in
production/critical environment.
  Contributions, feedback and bug reports are most welcome.


What is Miredo?
----------------

  Miredo is an Unix daemon program which implements the "Teredo:
Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through NATs" Internet draft specification.
At the moment, Miredo runs fine on GNU/Linux 2.4.x/2.6.x and not so
fine on FreeBSD 4.x/5.x. It can provide both server and relay
functionnality.

  It can be used to provide IPv6 connectivity to users behind NAT which
do not support IPv6, and not even proto-41 forwarding. For this to
work, users need to have a Teredo client running on their system.
Microsoft provides a Teredo client for Windows XP SP1 in its
"Advanced Networking pack". 

  For more informations on the Teredo technology, please refer to the
Microsoft IPv6 : Teredo overview.


Usage
------
  Miredo must be started by root. Miredo will always detach and run in the
background. Read your system logs to see what happens.


  If you have two subsequent static IPv4 addresses on your system, you
may be able to run a Teredo server. To start the program as a Teredo
server, type the following command:

# src/miredo -s 9.0.0.2 -u root

where it is assumed that 9.0.0.2 will be your server's primary IPv4
address, and 9.0.0.3 will be your server's secondary IPv4 address.


  Otherwise, it is possible to run a Teredo relay. To do so, you only
need to start miredo without parameters:

# src/miredo -u root

  That will created a virtual "teredo" networking interface which will
accept IPv6 traffic toward Teredo clients. Note that you must NOT be
behind a "restricted NAT" for this to work properly.
NOTE: If you are using FreeBSD, you will probably have to create a
route to the Teredo prefix (3ffe:831f::/32 at the moment) through the
tunnel by hand.

  If you don't use '-u root', Miredo will try to setuid as miredo,
which must then exists on your system.


Securing Miredo
----------------
  To mitigate risks and reduce exposure to potential hacking threat,
you should consider creating a "miredo" user on your system (that
should not be allowed to login). In its home, you should put these
files (assuming the home directory is /var/run/miredo):

/var/run/miredo/dev/null
/var/run/miredo/dev/net/tun		(Linux-only)
/var/run/miredo/dev/tun0...tun15	(FreeBSD)

  Additionnaly, you must tell your syslog daemon to listen to
/var/run/miredo/dev/log. That is usually done by adding that option to
your syslogd upon start: '-a /var/run/miredo/dev/log'.
If you don't do so, you won't get any logging information from Miredo.
  You can then run miredo inside a chroot jail (use option command line
option -t).
