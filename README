  Welcome to Miredo's introduction manual!

Where to go?
-------------
  If you've used olders versions of this program, you should read NEWS
for a summary of the most recent updates and changes.

  For detailled usage instructions, you should refer to the Unix manual
page miredo(8) which should be provided with your copy of the program.
In fact, it was not written yet, so you're out of luck.

  See INSTALL for instructions on how to build the package and install
the program from sources.

  This package is distributed under the terms of the General Public
License (GPL) version 2 written by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.
for full licensing details, please read COPYING.

  This software is at a very early development stage. Do NOT use it in
production/critical environment.
  Contributions, feedback and bug reports are most welcome.


What is Miredo?
----------------

  Miredo is an Unix daemon program which implements the "Teredo:
Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through NATs" Internet draft specification.
At the moment, Miredo only runs on GNU/Linux.
It can provide both server and relay functionnality.

  It can be used to provide IPv6 connectivity to users behind NAT which
do not support IPv6, and not even proto-41 forwarding. For this to
work, users need to have a Teredo client running on their system.
Microsoft provides a Teredo client for Windows XP SP1 in its
"Advanced Networking pack". 

  For more informations on the Teredo technology, please refer to the
Microsoft IPv6 : Teredo overview.


Usage
------
  Make sure you have enabled the "Universal TUNTAP driver" (CONFIG_TUN)
in your Linux kernel. Create the /dev/net/tun character device if it is
not already present:

# mkdir -p /dev/net
# mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200

  At the moment, the program expect to run both as a server and a relay
and there is no way to disable either mode yet. To start the program,
type the following command, as root:

# /usr/local/sbin/miredo 9.0.0.2 2001:dede::dead:beef &
# /sbin/ip -6 link set teredo up
# /sbin/ip -6 address add "TEREDO_PREFIX_STR":1/32 dev teredo

where:
* 9.0.0.2 will be your server's primary IPv4 address, and your
relay's IPv4 address as well. 9.0.0.3 (ie 9.0.0.2 + 1) will be your
server's secondary IPv4 address.
* 2001:dede::dead:beef will be your relay IPv6 address (which is only
used to send bubbles).

If you haven't installed miredo, run "src/miredo" instead of
"/usr/local/sbin/miredo".

Future versions of the program should configure the teredo interface
manually.
