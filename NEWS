BETA RELEASE 0.1.1 : Major feature enhancement

# Partial support for FreeBSD:
    Miredo should compile fine on FreeBSD, however it was not yet tested on
  that platform. Feedback is most welcome.

# Ability to disable server functionality:
    The server is now disabled by default.

# Ability to change the Teredo prefix (with -P).

# Ability to change the Teredo relay port (with -p).

# Automatic Teredo tunneling interface configuration:
    Miredo will automatically set the interface local IPv6 address, and set
  up an IPv6 route toward Teredo clients through the tunneling interface.
  Additionnaly, the interface MTU will be set to 1280 as suggested by the
  latest Teredo draft specification, and is automatically brought up and
  running.

# Possible vulnerabilities impact mitigation:
    Miredo will drop its root privileges as soon as possible, setuid to
  "miredo" user (which you should create, or change at configure time),
  and setgid to "nogroup".

# Background run:
    Miredo will automatically detach and run in the background as a "daemon".

# Automatic relay address configuration:
    One no longer has to specify the relay IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. This is
  no longer needed.

# Build-time support for Intel C++ Compiler 8.0.
