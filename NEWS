=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.2.2 : Minor portability fixes

# Support for binding the relay/client to a specific IPv4 address
  with the -b (--bind) command line option.
# Compilation fix for some old GNU libc.

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.2.1 : Major bugfixes

# Fixed a segmentation fault in Teredo server code.
# Fixed client-to-client connectivity with Microsoft and ng_teredo servers.
# Various minor client timing problem fixed.

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.2.0 : Major feature enhancement

# Ability to run as a Teredo client:
    Miredo can now server as a Teredo client. It will set up its Teredo
  address automatically from a server then forward packets. However, you
  have to add a default route to the Teredo tunneling interface if you want
  to use Miredo to access the IPv6 Internet as a whole, instead of only other
  Teredo clients. Of course, a server name to must be specified for the
  client mode to work.

# Ability to run behind a restricted NAT device:
    Miredo's Teredo relaying functions should now work fine from behind a
  restricted NAT device (such as most Linux/Netfilter-based NAT). If you are
  not behind a NAT or if you are behind a cone NAT, you can use command line
  option "-C" for optimization.

=============================================================================
ALPHA RELEASE 0.1.1 : Major feature enhancement

# Partial support for FreeBSD:
    Miredo should compile fine on FreeBSD, however it was not yet tested on
  that platform. Feedback is most welcome.

# Ability to disable server functionality:
    The server is now disabled by default.

# Ability to change the Teredo prefix (with -P).

# Ability to change the Teredo relay port (with -p).

# Automatic Teredo tunneling interface configuration:
    Miredo will automatically set the interface local IPv6 address, and set
  up an IPv6 route toward Teredo clients through the tunneling interface.
  Additionnaly, the interface MTU will be set to 1280 as suggested by the
  latest Teredo draft specification, and is automatically brought up and
  running.

# Possible vulnerabilities impact mitigation:
    Miredo will drop its root privileges as soon as possible, setuid to
  "miredo" user (which you should create, or change at run time), setgid,
  and chroot. For chroot to work, some manual setup is needed.

# Background run:
    Miredo will automatically detach and run in the background as a "daemon".

# Automatic relay address configuration:
    One no longer has to specify the relay IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. This is
  no longer needed.

# Signals handling: miredo can now be terminated cleanly.

# Minor compliance update for Teredo draft 02, various minor bugfixes.

# Added a manpage.

# Build-time support for Intel C++ Compiler 8.0.
